Async and await and promise was difficult to figure out.

inmage was burry had to figure out how to diplay pixels with out blurriness

Spent some time to figure out how to show the object with canvas. 
fillrect vs moveto and lineto.

Stuck on how to shift pieces around. The pieces would stack when they were next to each other instead of falling.

stored the temporary falling piece positions in an 2d array but switch to object because it is easier
to deal with.

Did rotating pieces was difficult and code is messy. Need to figure a way to clean up the code after.
